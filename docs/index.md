!!! info "ChemGraph"

    **ChemGraph** is an agentic framework that can automate molecular simulation workflows using large language models (LLMs). Built on top of `LangGraph` and `ASE`, ChemGraph allows users to perform complex computational chemistry tasks, from structure generation to thermochemistry calculations, with a natural language interface.

    ChemGraph supports diverse simulation backends, including ab initio quantum chemistry methods (e.g. coupled-cluster, DFT via NWChem, ORCA), semi-empirical methods (e.g., XTB via TBLite), and machine learning potentials (e.g, MACE, UMA) through a modular integration with `ASE`.
